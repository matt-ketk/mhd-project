  abstract={Error fields have been detected and quantified using the flux surface mapping diagnostic system on Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X). A low-field ‘ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/56/10/106005/nfaa3177ieqn001.gif] {${\rlap{-}\ \iota} =1/2$} ’ magnetic configuration ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/56/10/106005/nfaa3177ieqn002.gif] {${\rlap{-}\ \iota} =\iota /2\pi $} ), sensitive to error fields, was developed in order to detect their presence using the flux surface mapping diagnostic. In this configuration, a vacuum flux surface with rotational transform of n / m   =  1/2 is created at the mid-radius of the vacuum flux surfaces. If no error fields are present a vanishingly small n / m   =  5/10 island chain should be present. Modeling indicates that if an n   =  1 perturbing field is applied by the trim coils, a large n / m   =  1/2 island chain will be opened. This island chain is used to create a perturbation large enough to be imaged by the diagnostic. Phase and amplitude scans of the applied field allow the measurement of a small ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/56/10/106005/nfaa3177ieqn003.gif] {$\sim 0.04$} m intrinsic island chain with a ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/56/10/106005/nfaa3177ieqn004.gif] {${{130}^{\circ}}$} phase relative to the first module of the W7-X experiment. These error fields are determined to be small and easily correctable by the trim coil system.}

  abstract={Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) is currently under commissioning in preparation for its initial plasma operation phase, operation phase 1.1 (OP1.1). This first phase serves primarily to provide an integral commissioning of all major systems needed for plasma operation, as well as systems, such as diagnostics, that need plasma operation to verify their foreseen functions. In OP1.1, W7-X will have a reduced set of in-vessel components. In particular, five graphite limiter stripes replace the later foreseen divertor. This paper describes the expected machine capabilities in OP1.1, as well as a selection of physics topics that can be addressed in OP1.1, despite the simplified configuration and the reduced machine capabilities. Physics topics include the verification and adjustment of the magnetic topology, the testing of the foreseen plasma start-up scenarios and the feed-forward control of plasma density and temperature evolution, as well as more advanced topics such as scrape-off layer (SOL) studies at short connection lengths and transport studies. Plasma operation in OP1.1 will primarily be performed in helium, with a hydrogen plasma phase at the end.}
