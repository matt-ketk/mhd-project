We explore the ‘ideal interfaces’ posited by Multi-Region Relaxed Magneto-hydrodynamics (MRxMHD), which are highly localized currents that partition the plasma into discrete volumes. We do so by analyzing the properties of such interfaces. For this, our analysis of the ideal interfaces is carried out through two methods. Our first method involves boundary layer theory to examine the local properties of ideal interfaces. Combined with the methods developed by Hahm and Kulsrud, this is used to assess the robustness of ideal interfaces under non-ideal effects, such as resistivity.

MRxMHD has implications as a critical tool for designing the next-generation of optimized stellarators and has significant potential for modeling symmetry-breaking magnetic field perturbations in tokamaks.
